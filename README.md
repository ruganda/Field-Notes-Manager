  ### What is crop scouting?
  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOALTFgOoxM) This is a link to a youtube video that shows what is crop scouting.

  No need to watch the entire video. The most important thing to understand is that when someone is crop scouting, they usually take field notes.
  
  ### What is the problem that we want to solve with this web app?
  It's very common for these notes to be taken on paper, which makes it hard to manage. This web app will help manage these crop scouting notes by keeping them saved and ordered by date.
